# Tasks: Tarot Kart Bilgi Sayfaları (Blog/SEO)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-in-projeyi/` **Prerequisites**:
plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.9.2, React 18.3.1, Next.js 15.5.4, next-intl, Supabase
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities (TarotCard, CardContent, CardSEO, CardPage)
   → contracts/: 3 API endpoints + contract tests
   → research.md: Next.js App Router, multilingual URLs, SEO optimization
   → quickstart.md: 8 test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, component tests, E2E tests
   → Core: TypeScript types, database models, API endpoints, React components
   → Integration: database connection, i18n routing, image optimization
   → Polish: unit tests, performance tests, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Follow TDD: Tests → Implementation → Integration → Polish

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
