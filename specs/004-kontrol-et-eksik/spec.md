# Feature Specification: Kontrol Et Eksik Kalanlarƒ± Bul

**Feature Branch**: `004-kontrol-et-eksik`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "kontrol et eksik kalanlarƒ± bul
@@001-i-in-projeyi/"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for
   any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable
   and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a project manager or developer, I need to identify and track all incomplete
tasks in the tarot card implementation project so that I can prioritize
remaining work and ensure project completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a project with multiple phases and tasks, **When** I request a
   comprehensive analysis of missing items, **Then** I should receive a detailed
   report of all incomplete tasks across all phases
2. **Given** completed tasks are marked with [x], **When** I analyze the task
   list, **Then** I should see clear identification of which tasks remain
   incomplete
3. **Given** tasks have different priorities and dependencies, **When** I review
   the missing items, **Then** I should understand which tasks are blocking
   others and which can be done in parallel

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tasks are partially complete but not fully marked as done?
- How does the system handle tasks that have been completed but not properly
  marked in the tracking system?
- What if there are tasks that were added after the initial planning but not
  included in the main task list?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify all tasks marked as incomplete ([ ]) in the
  project task list
- **FR-002**: System MUST categorize incomplete tasks by phase (Setup, Tests,
  Implementation, Integration, Polish, Full Card Implementation)
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify tasks that can be executed in parallel ([P]
  marked tasks)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a summary of completion status for each phase
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify critical path tasks that block other tasks
  from completion
- **FR-006**: System MUST distinguish between different types of missing work
  (component tests, performance tests, documentation, translations, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide actionable next steps for completing the
  project

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Task**: Represents a specific work item with ID, description, completion
  status, and dependencies
- **Phase**: Represents a group of related tasks (Setup, Tests, Implementation,
  etc.)
- **Completion Status**: Tracks whether a task is complete ([x]) or incomplete
  ([ ])
