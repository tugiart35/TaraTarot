      "1": "People born on the 1st come into the world with a strong sense of individuality. From early in life, they feel the need to chart their own path, make independent decisions, and lead. The spark burning within them constantly guides them toward new beginnings and new opportunities. These individuals are courageous, determined, and often become examples to those around them with their pioneering ideas.\n\nHowever, this strong leadership energy can sometimes turn into an overly self-centered or authoritarian attitude. People born on the 1st risk isolation if they don't learn to collaborate with others. When balanced, they become a guiding light in both their own lives and the lives of others.",
      "2": "Those born on the 2nd come into the world with energy built on harmony, balance, and relationships. They are natural mediators with unique abilities in resolving conflicts, bringing different parties together, and creating collaborative environments. In their lives, they typically seek mutual understanding, intimacy, and emotional depth.\n\nOn the other hand, this sensitivity can make them easily hurt. The desire to over-accommodate can cause them to put their own desires in the background. When they find healthy balance, they become a reliable and supportive guide for others.",
      "3": "People born on the 3rd come to life's stage with a creative, energetic, and joyful spirit. Their strongest aspect is their ability to express themselves; they can showcase themselves in art, writing, speaking, or design. They easily stand out in social relationships and become a light that inspires people.\n\nHowever, they may sometimes show tendencies to be superficial or scattered. Lack of discipline in their lives can prevent them from fully utilizing their talents. When focused, they release tremendous creativity and energy that brings happiness to people.",
      "4": "Those born on the 4th are people who bring order, discipline, and structure. They are reliable, hardworking, and responsible individuals. When faced with difficulties, they progress patiently and systematically. They want to build a solid foundation for their lives and create stability for both themselves and their loved ones.\n\nAt times, they can be rigid, stubborn, or overly controlling. This can make flexibility difficult in relationships. When they develop flexibility, they achieve lasting success by building a solid structure in both their own lives and their surroundings.",
      "5": "Those born on the 5th are representatives of freedom, adventure, and change. They constantly seek new experiences and are nourished by meeting different cultures and people. They learn quickly and easily adapt to the changes life brings.

They don't want to limit themselves. But when they learn to balance freedom with responsibility, their lives become an inspiring journey of discovery.",
      "6": "People born on the 6th carry love, harmony, and responsibility energy. They feel deep loyalty to their families, friends, and community.

      "7": "Those born on the 7th are investigative, deep-thinking, and intuitive individuals. They have a spirit that questions life and seeks the mystery behind truth.

      "8": "People born on the 8th are representatives of power, management, and material success. They have a natural talent in business, organization, and strategy.

      "9": "Those born on the 9th are compassionate, idealistic, and artistic-spirited individuals. They place serving humanity, sharing goodness and beauty at the center of their lives. With their creative aspects, they can make a difference in society and touch others' lives.\n\nSometimes they can be overly emotional, dreamy, or self-sacrificing.

      "11": "Those born on the 11th are intuitive, visionary, and spiritually strong individuals. Their energy operates at high frequency and inspires those around them.
