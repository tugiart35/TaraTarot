# i18n (Internationalization) Roadmap

**Goal:**  
Implement and maintain multi-language support without disrupting current UI or app logic.

---

## Plan

- [ ] List all user-facing strings/components.
- [ ] Migrate hard-coded text to i18n JSONs (`lib/i18n/locales/{lang}/`).
- [ ] Keep JSON keys organized by module/feature (auth, tarot, numerology, etc.).
- [ ] Test each language switch for UI/UX consistency.
- [ ] Avoid breaking any layout or workflow during migration.
