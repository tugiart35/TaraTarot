# Directory & Refactor Plan

**Goal:**  
Reorganize the project structure and refactor code for maximum modularity and maintainability, without breaking any existing features or designs.

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Directory Review:**  
   - List all files and their roles.
   - Identify redundant, unused, or duplicate files/components.

2. **Naming Consistency:**  
   - Propose clear, descriptive names for all files/folders.
   - Document confusing or misleading names.

3. **Refactor Suggestions:**  
   - Note functions/components that should be merged, split, or moved.
   - Highlight code that can be modularized.

4. **Proposed New Structure:**  
   - Draft a modular folder/component structure.
   - Map current files to new locations.

5. **Migration Checklist:**  
   - Only update files that are not critical to current operation at first.
   - Always test in a staging branch before merging changes.

> **Visual design, UI, and existing logic must remain unchanged during the restructure.**
