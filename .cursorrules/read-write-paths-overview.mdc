# Firebase Read/Write Paths Overview

**Goal:**  
Document all current Firebase collections, document paths, and what data is stored/read in each.

---

## Main Paths

| Collection/Document Path        | Purpose                  | Example Fields         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| /users/{uid}                   | User profile info        | email, name, credits  |
| /tarot_readings/{readingId}    | Tarot reading results    | userId, cards, result |
| /numerology_reports/{reportId} | Numerology reports       | userId, results       |
| /credits/{uid}                 | Credit balance/history   | balance, transactions |

---

## Rules

- All new data flows must be added here before implementation.
- No schema/path changes should break current user flows or UI.
