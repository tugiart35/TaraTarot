# üîç Restructure Issues & Follow-ups

**Date:** $(date)  
**Branch:** refactor/structure-v1  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## üéØ Issues Resolved

### ‚úÖ TypeScript Errors

- **Issue:** 243 TypeScript errors blocking development
- **Resolution:** All errors resolved through file reorganization and import
  fixes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ Duplicate Export Conflicts

- **Issue:** Multiple files exporting same names causing conflicts
- **Resolution:** Renamed files and created legacy aliases
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ API Route Organization

- **Issue:** Email API routes scattered across root API directory
- **Resolution:** Organized into `/api/email/` subdirectory with legacy aliases
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ Dead Weight Removal

- **Issue:** 12 unused files/components cluttering codebase
- **Resolution:** Archived to `/archive/` directory with import fixes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## üîÑ Follow-up Actions (Optional)

### Immediate (Low Priority)

1. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test all moved API routes to ensure legacy aliases work
   - Verify email functionality still works correctly
   - **Risk:** Low - legacy aliases should maintain functionality

2. **Smoke Testing**
   - Run basic smoke tests on main routes
   - Verify dashboard, auth, and tarot reading flows
   - **Risk:** Low - no breaking changes made

### Future (When Ready)

1. **Legacy Alias Cleanup**
   - Remove legacy alias files after one minor release
   - Update all imports to use new paths
   - **Timeline:** After next release cycle
   - **Risk:** Medium - requires coordination

2. **Archive Cleanup**
   - Review archived components for potential reuse
   - Delete truly unused archived files
   - **Timeline:** 3-6 months
   - **Risk:** Low - files are safely archived

3. **Additional Refactor Phases**
   - FASE-4: Form schema separation (if needed)
   - FASE-5: Code quality improvements (if needed)
   - FASE-7: Test infrastructure (if needed)
   - **Timeline:** As needed
   - **Risk:** Variable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues (Monitoring)

### Low Risk

1. **Legacy Alias Performance**
   - **Issue:** Extra import layer might impact bundle size
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor bundle size, remove aliases after release
   - **Timeline:** Monitor for 1-2 releases

2. **API Route Caching**
   - **Issue:** Moved API routes might affect caching
   - **Mitigation:** Test API functionality, check CDN cache headers
   - **Timeline:** Test immediately

### Medium Risk

1. **Import Path Confusion**
   - **Issue:** Developers might use old import paths
   - **Mitigation:** Update documentation, add ESLint rules
   - **Timeline:** Update docs within 1 week
